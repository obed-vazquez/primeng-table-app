## 3) How to Deploy?

### - Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### - Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### - Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## 4) What are the Contribution guidelines?

#### 4.1) Writing tests.

_No custom unit tests have been implemented, please propose or ask for any suggestions._
To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```


Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

#### 4.2) Code review.

_Request if needed._

#### 4.3) Other guidelines.

_Please ask for the code standard to use as a guideline and reflect it in the project._
